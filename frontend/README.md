# AngularJS UI for Secret Santa Tutorial Application


## Overview

This application takes the developer through the process of building a web-application using
AngularJS. The application is loosely based on the **Google Phone Gallery**, which no longer exists.
Here is a historical reference: [Google Phone Gallery on WayBack][google-phone-gallery]

### Node.js and Tools

- Get [Node.js][node].
- Install the tool dependencies: `npm install`


## Workings of the Application

- There is a dynamic backend (application server) for this application. 


## Development with `angular-phonecat`

The following docs describe how you can check this application further.

### Installing Dependencies

The application relies upon various Node.js tools, such as [Bower][bower], [Karma][karma] and
[Protractor][protractor]. You can install these by running:

```
npm install
```

This will also run Bower, which will download the Angular files needed for the current step of the
tutorial.

Most of the scripts described below will run this automatically but it doesn't do any harm to run
it whenever you like.

### Running the Application during Development

- Run `npm start`.
- Navigate your browser to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) to see the application 
  running.

### Unit Testing

I remove this part, so it should be not running properly, skip this step please.

### End-to-End Testing
